### 📌 Pinned Project: [Necessary Oscillations](https://github.com/bbarclay/oscillation-adaptability)

I'm currently focused on developing a mathematical framework that demonstrates how oscillatory behavior emerges as a necessary consequence of systems optimizing for order while maintaining conservation constraints. This research has applications across neuroscience, ecology, quantum systems, and economics.
